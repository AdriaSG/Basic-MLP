# MyFistPerceptron
In this exercise I had: 

* implement a **multilayer perceptron** (MLP) in keras
* apply the MLP to a linear and a non-linear classification problem
* evaluate the train/validation/test accuracies
* tune hyperparameters with [keras-tuner](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner)

Credits for the task to Prof. Felix Biessman at BHT.
